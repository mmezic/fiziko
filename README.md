This is my copy of a github repository which contains the most epic metapost code in the whole universe.

This MetaPost library was initially written to automate some elements of black and white illustrations for a physics textbook. First and foremost it provides functions to draw things like lines of variable width, shaded spheres and tubes of different kinds, which can be used to produce images of a variety of objects. The library also contains functions to draw some objects constructed from these primitives.

Here's a [blog post](https://m.habr.com/en/post/454376/) describing the project in more detail.
